			<h1>Projects</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>This page summarises the projects I had taken on along with my upcoming and/or ongoing projects, excluding academic and/or work-related projects. You will find some of the projects would open roles for people to jump in and work with me directly, as such keep an eye out on open roles and contact me for further details if you are interested in any of them.
			<br>While expecting a relatively low commitment, I expect a solid teamwork throughout and after for each of my projects.</p>
