                <hr>
                <p>I am Alvin Hartanto, a second year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Nottingham Malaysia. Being a student does not stop me from personally indulging in my own interests which include game development, reading books, cooking, and etc. While I take on my studies seriously, I also challenge myself out of the campus through various activities, such as volunteering and taking on personal projects.
