            <h1>Project Mentle</h1>

            <p>Project Mentle is a community project I kickstarted in May 2022, which aims to promote growth among youths. While mainly targetting university students, Mentle is planned to expand towards both high schools and industries, building a bridge that connects the three levels in all. Thus, providing experience and insight not only for the students' community but also for young professionals in building the confidence on their skills while witnessing growth of younger generations.
            <br>Project Mentle currently runs voluntarily and is open to the public to join, either as a Contributing Member or as Participants.
            <br>
            <br>While this page will provide an overview of Project Mentle in summary, feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in Project Mentle.</p>
